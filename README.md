Task Management Web Application
This is a simple Task Management application that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. 
The app uses local storage to persist the tasks, meaning that tasks are saved directly in your browser. 
When you close and reopen the tab or refresh the page, your tasks will still be there, as long as you're on the same device.

Key Features:
Add new tasks to your Task Manager
Mark tasks as completed
Delete tasks
Tasks are stored locally in the browser's local storage

How It Works:
This project uses the browser's local storage to save your tasks. Since it doesn't rely on a server or database, the tasks are saved on the specific device where you're using the application. 
This means that tasks won't sync across different devices, but they will remain saved on each device, even after closing the browser or refreshing the page.

Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript (local storage API)
